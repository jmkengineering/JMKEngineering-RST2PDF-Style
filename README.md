# JMKEngineering RST2PDF Style

This is the default JMK Engineering RST2PDF Style sheet for reports and memos.

This year we have started using RestructuredText to develop client memos, reports, etc. We deliver them in PDF using [rst2pdf](https://rst2pdf.org). The best [handbook for RST2PDF is here](http://rst2pdf.ralsina.me/handbook.html).

The .yaml file has everything that I need to make the reports look really close to those that I developed in MS WORD. 

## Why RestructuredText vs WORD?

Why did I go though this process? I wanted something simple that has the ability to create complex reports with a lot of people at the same time without relying on various cloud services. 

By using a markup language and [git](https://git-scm.com) we can accomplish this with anyone in the world. From my experience WORD wasn't playing nice (even though I think is should) and a markup langauge can be edited in any text editor. No special software required.

I can also create reports, mini-sites for special reports and pages/articles for our [main site](https://jmkengineering.com) with a common set of standards. If I wanted to copy/paste exerpts from the website into a report, it is as simple as going to the source code and ctrl-c, ctrl-v. Everything will look exactly the way that I want.
